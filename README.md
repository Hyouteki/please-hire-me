## What is this?
This repository manages a  [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NcB1bmKRg-j56KUsd7WNHYpkVBx0S7Jkr26LyeJW8HQ) in which leet code users (volunteers) have to mandatorily solve a specified number of questions each week. Furthermore, if they fail to do so, the repository will mark them Dead on the sheet and will not track their progress any further.
